# Sesmester-Project-1
Team Collaboration for First Semester Project: World of Zuul

### File Distribution

- **Darwin_Homeworld.cs**: Introductory explanation of the game for Luigi.
- **Era 1.cs**: Klara's file.
- **Era 2 (Bees).cs**: Lukas' file.
- **Era 2 (Corals).cs**: Arda's file.
- **Era 3 (SDU)**: Manish's file.

This structure allows us to collaborate efficiently without interfering with each other's work. Each contributor focuses on their designated era, ensuring their changes are isolated and visible when their specific era appears in the game.

If you modify files outside your designated area, please be sure to add comments explaining the changes you made.

- **EraTitle.cs**: Handles the display and formatting of each era's title.
- **Portal.cs**: Contains the teleportation logic and manages how each file is executed in the game. I've added detailed comments throughout to clarify the implementation as much as possible.
